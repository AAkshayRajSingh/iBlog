# iBlog

The Blog Website is a dynamic platform that allows users to publish a variety of tales and points of view. Anyone can become a contributor, and each user is free to produce postings, comment on existing content, and express their approval (or disapproval) for each article. Posts can be categorized using relevant tags that define the type of information they address. View statistics allow users to track the popularity of their postings. Administrators can utilize the website to make changes to user accounts, and users can update their own settings. Users can function as administrators, creators/authors, viewers, or a combination of these roles, depending on their permissions. The Blog Website Social Platform collects and publishes user data.
Here we have used the CREATE , UPDATE , DELETE operations (CRUD) to manipulate the data present in the Database.
